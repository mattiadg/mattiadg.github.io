Hey everybody, I'm Mattia from Palermo, Italy. I'm finishing my studies in Computer Science and now I'm trying to become active in
the OSS community. I made large use of open source software but I never found the time (my fault) to give my contribution to some project.
My first occasion to move on was the discovery of this year's hacktoberfest, thanks to which I did my first pull request.
After that some others pull request arrived one after another and now I want to become an active participant in the OSS community, at 
least for what I can do.
This short blog post represents my second step in this direction, after the hacktoberfest, and a commit to force me to continue this way.

I hope I can be helpful for someone.

Stay tuned!
