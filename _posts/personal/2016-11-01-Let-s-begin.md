Last wednesday I defended my master thesis and finally concluded my path at University of Palermo.
Now, it's time to begin a new and totally different experience by beginning my PhD at University of Trento and FBK (Bruno Kessler Foundation),
 for which I'll leave in two days. 
I'm going to study Deep Learning for Machine Translation, a really interesting topic for which there has been an explosion of papers in the last three
years, and it didn't even exist before 2014. 
I wanted to share my excitement with everybody and I promise, the next post will be technical and will bring some novelties in the blog.
See you soon!
