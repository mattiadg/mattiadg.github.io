Hi, 

I'm Mattia Di Gangi, currently PhD candidate at University of Trento, Italy, and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Trento, Italy.
My research topic is Neural Machine Translation, but I'm interested more broadly in NLP and AI.

In the course of my research on NMT, I studied the effects of word embeddings computed on monolingual data, the effect of ASR noise and multilinguality.
My current research efforts are directed to propose new deep learning architectures that can solve some problems of NMT. I hope to disclose more (with a paper!)
very soon.

This website is under construction. Currently it contains my contacts, my resum√©, a list of my publications and a map of the places where I gave a talk.
I'm going to expand it soon with some pdf files of my papers and hopefully some useful blog posts about NMT.
