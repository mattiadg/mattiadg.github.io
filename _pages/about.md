Hi, 

I'm Mattia Di Gangi, currently PhD candidate at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) and the University of Trento, Italy.
My research topic is Neural Machine Translation, but I have more broad interests in NLP and deep learning.

In the course of my research on NMT, I studied the effects of word embeddings computed on monolingual data, the effect of ASR noise, multilinguality, deep learning architectures for MT and end-to-end speech translation.
My current research efforts are directed to assess the effectiveness of end-to-end speech translation.

This website is under construction. Currently it contains my contacts, my resum√©, a list of my publications and my contact links.
I'm going to expand it soon with some pdf files of my papers and my blog posts.
