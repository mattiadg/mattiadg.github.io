These days I'm preparing for my Master degree thesis defence. The time is
too short and there's no space for wasting words.
In order to perform well, repetitions and pauses must be well balanced.
There is a need knowing exactly what you need to say, while showing that
you're really thinking about what you say and not repeating like a parrot.
That would bore the audience, and that's not what you expect with a thesis
regarding sarcasm detection.
I'm still working on it.
